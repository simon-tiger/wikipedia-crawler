# wikipedia-crawler
This is a wikipedia crawler/graph-of-relatedness revealer.

## How it Works
Enter a query (e. g. `apple`) and either hit Enter or press the button "Query the API". If an article called "Apple" exists, a circle will pop up with th word "Apple" in it. If an article called "Apple" doesn't exist, a circle with something alse will pop up. Click the circle (or article) to reveal its related articles. As you might expect, you can click any of those articles to reveal its related articles.

## Insperation
The insperation comes from [Daniel Shiffman](https://github.com/shiffman) and its [Coding Train](https://github.com/CodingTrain). Hopefully, once it's there, there will be a link to Daniel's version here.
